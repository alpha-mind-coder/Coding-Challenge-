As i mentioned yesterday we will continue are 90 DAYS challenge and its Day2 of it:-
so we were succesful in continuing our plan i completed
           -> the prefix pattern 
           -> have completed our acadamic syllabus 
           -> was not able to do pointers but will do it today 
## TODAY'S PROBLEM SOLVED
Find first and last position of an element ->34
HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT BEFORE BUT AS I WAS DOING RECURSION SO DID IT WITH RECURSION FOR PRACTICE
class Solution {
public:
int res =-1;
    int binarysearch(vector<int>& nums, int target,bool flag,int s,int e){
        int mid=s+(e-s)/2;
        if(s>e){
            return res;}

        if(nums[mid]>target){
            return binarysearch(nums, target,flag,s,mid-1);
        }    
        
        if(nums[mid]<target){
            return binarysearch(nums, target,flag,mid+1,e);
        }  
       
           res=mid;
            if(flag){
                return binarysearch(nums, target,flag,s,mid-1);
            }
            else{
                 return binarysearch(nums, target,flag,mid+1,e);
            }
       return res;
    }
    vector<int> searchRange(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int leftmost = binarysearch(nums,target,true,0,nums.size()-1);
        int rightmost = binarysearch(nums,target,false,0,nums.size()-1);
        return {leftmost,rightmost};
    }
};
Have also solved one another problem will add it soon

## TOMMOROWS PLAN
->To continue with pointers
->To continue acadamic syllabus
->To go in depth of recursion by doing the some previous question like pivot index that we need in binary search through recursion method

## THIS WILL HELP ME REVISE THE PREVIOUS TOPICS AS WELL AND WILL ALSO MAKE ME BETTER IN RECURSION 
So it's two with one offer :)

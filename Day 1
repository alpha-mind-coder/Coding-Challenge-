Hii guys! Lets start the THREE MONTH CHALLENGE(90 DAYS) to complete our DSA practice .
We will be doing two things first right now focusing on completing the most frequently used patterns in DSA

1. Prefix

# lets do 4 to 5 questions on this pattern then will move on next pattern 
     (right now have solved three questions on it)
->first understood about left boundary and right boundary how its used in different problems
->and how to use unordered_map with it which actually make prefix pattern useful in most of the questions 
->also understood that we can do the prefix problem in its own array also without taking a new array and how its useful in most of the cases
  // changes is made in actuall array however if want to further use the array it should not be done in same array

## SO I M GLAD THAT TODAY WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET AS WE PLANNED
We did 2 questions in coding which was just the revision of previous topics through recursion method

1. Peak Index In A Mountain Array->852
   class Solution {
public:
int ans=-1;
    int binarysearch(vector<int>& arr,int s,int e){
        if(arr.size()==1)return 0;
        
       if(s>e){
            return ans;
        } 
        int mid = s+(e-s)/2;
        if(arr[mid]<arr[mid+1]){
        return binarysearch(arr,mid+1,e);
        }

        else if(arr[mid]>arr[mid+1]){
            ans = mid;
        return binarysearch(arr,s,mid-1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr) {
        int s=0,e=arr.size()-1;
        return binarysearch(arr,s,e);
          
    }
};  


2. Find Minimum In Rotated Sorted Array->153
    class Solution {
public:
int binarysearch(vector<int>& nums,int s,int e){
    if(s==e) return e;
    int mid=s+(e-s)/2;
    if(nums[mid]>nums[e]){
        return binarysearch(nums,mid+1,e);
    }
    else{
       return binarysearch(nums,s,mid);
    }
    return e;

}
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int s=0,e=nums.size()-1;
        return binarysearch(nums,s,e);
    }
};

*Although these two were easy question but these are important to clear my recursion concept and to revise the previous things 

I studied pointer and structures with pointer although i do have some doubts in structure with pointer yet we will cover that tommorrow
Also did a little acadamic work .


##TOMMOROWS PLAN
->structure with pointer 
->complete the revision of binary search through recursion also planned to do some new good questions of binaray search with both recursion and without it
->operating system (paging ,segmentation)

## Day 0 - Committing to Consistency
I've been coding in C++ for a while and have already solved 50+ problems on LeetCode. However, consistency has been a challenge. From today, I am making a commitment to daily problem-solving and diving deep into DSA to sharpen my problem-solving skills for college placements.

## My Goals Moving Forward:
1.  Solve at least one coding problem daily (LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks)
2.Strengthen core DSA topics (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)
3.  Focus on problem patterns and improve coding speed
4. Maintain daily progress updates in this repository
5. Stay consistent and disciplined until placements

## Why This Matters?
Consistency is the key to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. By solving problems every day and analyzing different approaches, I aim to:
1. Improve logic-building and problem-solving
2. Get better at time and space complexity analysis
3. Develop the ability to tackle real-world coding interviews
4. Build a strong foundation for competitive programming and system design

This repository will be my public commitment to staying on track and improving daily. If you're on a similar journey, let's connect, collaborate, and grow together!
